## Yahallo 👋

I'm Rob (or Trigger). I studied game programming in college, although a lot of my experience comes from personal projects and OpenRCT2 contributions. My preferred languages are high-level ones like C# and Python, but my roots are in C++. I developed a hobby for reversing file formats as a necesity through various projects (as early as 2014), and that eventually snowballed into a passion for learning about and documenting program internals (primarily visual novel engines).

### 🌠 Fun facts

* 🐍 Python Interactive Shell is a fantastic tool for reversing+analyzing data and patterns on the fly.

* 🗜️ **78 DA** (&thinsp;xZ&thinsp;) is the most exciting thing to find in a hexdump.

* 🔐 Faulty implementations of CRC-32 are the *"best"* encryption method.
